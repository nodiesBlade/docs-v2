# POKT Gateway Server API Endpoints

The Gateway Server currently exposes all its API endpoints in form of HTTP endpoints. Note, we can move this to Swagger in the future if our API endpoints become more complex.

`x-api-key`  is an api key set by the gateway operator to transmit internal private data
